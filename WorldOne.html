	<div id="One"><p>It was a calm afternoon when you stumbled upon a crashed airplane. You can search the inside (1), or try to power it up (2).</p></div>
	<div id="Two"><p>After walking for 10 minutes you meet Bob the Kitten. You can give him some milk (1), or kill him (2).</p></div>
	<div id="Three"><p>You were calmly walking, until a bandit jumped you. You woke up tied up. You can shout for help (1), or try to flatter him (2).</p></div>
	<div id="Four"><p>You were travelling at night, when a shooting star appeared. You can think of a wish (1), or continue walking (2).</p></div>
	<div id="Five"><p>It was a rainy day when you saw an abandoned wagon and decided to hide there for a bit. You found a frog there. You can kiss it (1), or eat it (2).</p></div>
	<div id="Six"><p>The sun is setting and you want to sleep. You can try to sleep in a tree (1), or on a beach (2).</p></div>
	<div id="Seven"><p>You find a strange seemingly abandoned house. You can knock on the door (1), or just go through (2).</p></div>
	<div id="Eight"><p>You find a doll on the road. You can take it (1), or leave it (2).</p></div>
	<div id="Nine"><p>While walking you encounter Antaniukas - the car model hobbyist. You can talk to him (1), or compliment him (2).</p></div>
	<div id="Ten"><p>You were walking through a deep forest, when you met Paulius the Tiger. You can shout at him (1), or feed him (2).</p></div>
	<br>
	<div id="OneOne"><p class="reply">You find a secret  compartment that contains some coke. Seems like a win to me!</p></div>
	<div id="TwoTwo"><p class="reply">The kitten was quite happy, since the last time he drank milk, was when his mom still fed him.</p></div>
	<div id="ThreeThree"><p class="reply">You started shouting for help. Lucky you, the bandit's name was Help. He got scared, thinking you are a magician, and let you go.</p></div>
	<div id="FourFour"><p class="reply">While you were thinking of a wish the star fell down...<br>...on your head, it started bleeding.</p></div>
	<div id="FiveFive"><p class="reply">You kissed it and nothing happened. Such a surprise!</p></div>
	<div id="SixSix"><p class="reply">You start sleeping on a tree, but end up sleeping on the ground. Congrats - you now have a headache!</p></div>
	<div id="SevenSeven"><p class="reply">You knock on the door, unfortunately wolves hear the knock and attack you. You are injured and lucky to be alive.</p></div>
	<div id="EightEight"><p class="reply">You take the doll. A cursed doll. Congratulations! Now you are unable to have a good rest!</p></div>
	<div id="NineNine"><p class="reply">You start talking, he tells you his deepest desires. He starts talking so enthusiastically, he starts crying over the fact that he doesn't have "Ford Cactus".</p></div>
	<div id="TenTen"><p class="reply">You start shouting and he starts crying, runs back home.</p></div>

	<div id="OneOneOne"><p class="reply">You try to power it up, but the badly damaged engine blows up.</p></div>
	<div id="TwoTwoTwo"><p class="reply">You attacked, but he was ready. 20 other kittens jumped you and music started playing:<br>Everybody was kung fu fighting, (ooogh, aaagh).<br>Those CATS were fast as lightning (ooogh, aaagh).<br>It was very very frightening, (ooogh, aaagh).<br>but they fought with expert timing (ooogh, aaagh).</p></div>
	<div id="ThreeThreeThree"><p class="reply">You tried to flatter him, but the bandit was highly depressed, and misstook your compliments as irony. He was so angry that he didn't even see how you ran away.</p></div>
	<div id="FourFourFour"><p class="reply">You continued walking and nothing happened.</p></div>
	<div id="FiveFiveFive"><p class="reply">You eat it and become french. Why? Because the french eat frogs, and my sense of humour is trash.</p></div>
	<div id="SixSixSix"><p class="reply">You get woken up by the waves that tried to choke you. You are fairly well rested.</p></div>
	<div id="SevenSevenSeven"><p class="reply">You open the doors and find some antidepressants. You can finally feel happy for an hour.</p></div>
	<div id="EightEightEight"><p class="reply">You left it. It seems like it was a voodoo doll because 2 hours later your whole body started aching. Most likely somebody ran over it.</p></div>
	<div id="NineNineNine"><p class="reply">He was so happy, because somebody was actually nice to him.</p></div>
	<div id="TenTenTen"><p class="reply">You give him some meat, sadly he eats not only the meat, but your arm too!</p></div>
