    //Michael
    scenario: "You were running from a mildly annoyed racoon when you found Michael - the abandoned car chair. What was Michael doing? I'm glad you asked since he was mourning the loss of his car chair friends. He was sad that there was no one whose ass he could heat. He was sad that there was no annoying brat who would throw half-eaten cookies on him. Michael lived a happy life and now he was longing for it to come back.",
    reply1: "The moment your pants touched him, the belt automatically fastened and the car chair had a change of heart. It started laughing like a true supervillain. Moments later a gang of car chairs jumped out of the surrounding bushes. You realised that you had fallen for a trap.",
    answer1: "Sit on him",
    damage1: 50,
    reply2: "The moment the cookies touched the chair, it started to groan out of happiness. It looked like old friends coming together. It was a view to behold.",
    answer2: "Throw some half-eaten cookies on him",
    damage2: 0,
    reply3: "The chair started crying, but after wrestling with its feelings for a minute it calmed down. Apparently, a child used to sit on it. He was an angry brat and loved punching the chair without a good reason. Having endured the abuse for 2 years, Michael decided that he had enough and started fighting back. The problem is that he underestimated his own strength and accidentally injured the child. That is why he was abandoned.",
    answer3: "Ask why he was abandoned",

    //Sword
    scenario: "You were doing what you do best - walking when something shining came into your view. Intrigued by the light you slowly started going deeper and deeper into the forest. When you were about 4 minutes from the main path you noticed that the glowing thing was a sword. It was stuck inside a rock. You noticed that someone else had tried to pull it out, not only that, there were some fresh footprints on the grass.",
    reply1: "At first, you tried to bash it with another rock, but nothing happened. Your second idea was to bash it with an even bigger rock but yet again, nothing happened. Your last idea was bashing it with the biggest rock you could find, but even a big rock couldn’t smash it into pieces.",
    answer1: "Try to break the rock",
    damage1: 0,
    reply2: "You followed the footprints for a couple of minutes when you found a camp of friendly explorers. They welcomed you with open arms. Apparently, they came here to try to get the magical sparkling sword that no one has ever managed to recover. After hearing that hundreds of people have tried to get it, you lost all hope of having the sparkling sword. After all, you couldn’t be the chosen hero… OR COULD YOU?",
    answer2: "Try to follow the footprints",
    damage2: 0,
    reply3: "You firmly grabbed the sword by its handle and started pulling it out. To your surprise it was quite light, it seemed like it was made out of paper. You were so happy that you failed to notice that the bushes that the footprints lead to started moving. Suddenly 3 people surrounded you. Due to the confusion, you failed to notice the fact that they fucking stabbed you 3 times and left you lying on the ground. Well, guess who has the magical sparkling sword now…",
    answer3: "Pull the sword out yourself",

    //Flower patch
    scenario: "Yet again, you were walking through a forest, when you saw a patch of flowers. Some were purple, some were yellow. As you knew nothing about flowers, you couldn’t tell whether they are poisonous or helpful. After staring at them for some time you decided that not doing something about those flowers would be awful.",
    reply1: "You decided to stomp on the flower patch. Soon the grass looked better than the garden. After all, that is what you get for showing off yourself, you slutty flowers!",
    answer1: "Absolutely destroy the flowers",
    damage1: 0,
    reply2: "Quite soon you realised that you made a mistake. You chose to use the flowers as perfume without even knowing how they smell. The problem is that they smelled like fresh cow shit. Let’s just say that the following day everyone thought you were very classy.",
    answer2: "Use a flower as perfume",
    damage2: 0,
    reply3: "You opened your diary that you have had the entire time apparently, you picked up your pen and realised that you can’t read nor write. You put the diary and the pan back to their place and started cursing your parents for not providing education.",
    answer3: "Write about their beautiful colours in your diary",
